Overall Project Description:
 
What is your product, on a high level?
The product is a hosted, web-based plan-maker for aircraft trips, check downtime for maintenance and see future availability for various airline and flights, as well as managing crew schedules and qualifications
 
Whom is it for?
Corporate Flight Department, Management company.
 
What problem does it solve?
Flight Schedules are complicated. We are required to have a finite number of crew and airplanes that can work and shift 24/24 but can also balance with rest and maintenance time. Each of the crew member must also carrying with a large variety of document and medical certificate because we are travelling country to country. On top of that, we also have a problem of delay and conflict between each trip, tracking permission between each aircraft, etc. For the above reason, we believe a program that can help us organizing these things is much needed.
 
What alternatives are available?
Delta, CAMP, American Airlines, Alexis
 
Why is this project compelling and worth developing?
There’s plenty of services for flight schedule for customer. However, when it comes to flight managements for crew members and Flight Departments, the options are very limited, even though it is still a very important problem. That in itself is enough to make this project compelling and worth developing
 
Describe the top-level objectives, differentiators, target customers, and scope of your product?
Top-level objectives
Create an application that manages Flight schedules as well as Crew member documents
 
Differentiators
We provide a more convenient and modern approach for Flight Scheduling and Managing.
 
Target Customers.
Corporate Flight Department.
Managements Companies
 
Scope of product.
Make flight schedule browsing, tracking more convenient and easier to follow.
 
What are the competitors and what is novel in your approach?
We are creating a managing system for Fight Schedule. Our Competitors are legacy companies that have a traditional way of dealing with problems like using whiteboards, excels and social messenger for schedule as well as those application with the same idea. We are aiming to build a more convenient and easier to manage interface for the problems. We’re also confident that we can offer much-need features and customer services that can directly compete with those products that had the same idea.
 
Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology?
We have the technical abilities to create a service platform for Flight Managing.
 
What is interesting about this project from a technical point of view?
This project is interesting because there have not been much contributions to the subjects as a technical solution, which means more rooms for improvements. We also have the chance to implement a variety of new and complicate algorithms because we are working with a very large and changing database “Big Data”. Along with that we will connecting to API to facilitate the monetary aspect of the service as mediator.
